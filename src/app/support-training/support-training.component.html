      <h2>EnergyPlus University Course Teaching Material</h2>
      <p>The following curriculum outline and accompanying PowerPoint slides are intended to aid professors in teaching
        a course on EnergyPlus. The course is designed for upper-level undergraduate as well as graduate students. The
        primary audience is students of mechanical or architectural engineering with a background in heat transfer and
        thermodynamics. Instructors in affiliated fields such as civil engineering, architecture, etc., may need to
        supplement some of the lecture material with more basic information on heat transfer, thermodynamics, engineering
        analysis, etc.</p>
