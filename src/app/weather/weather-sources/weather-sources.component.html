        <h2 id="CWEC">Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations (CWEC)</h2>
        <p>The 80 CWEC files contain hourly weather observations representing an artificial one-year period specifically designed for building energy calculations. All 80 locations in the CWEC data set are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.</p>
        <p>Produced by Numerical Logics in collaboration with Environment Canada and the National Research Council of Canada, the CWEC were derived using a methodology similar to the TMY2 (see below). CWEC hourly files represent weather conditions
          that result in approximately average heating and cooling loads in buildings. The National Energy Code of Canada requires the use of a CWEC file representative of a location when the performance path and customized design calculations are
          chosen as the means of building energy consumption compliance. The CWEC follow the ASHRAE WYEC2 (Weather Year for Energy Calculation 2) format and were derived from the Canadian Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) of hourly weather
          information for Canada from the 1953-1995 period of record. The CWEC are available from <a href="http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/"> Environment Canada</a>. The reference for the CWEC is:</p>

        <p>Originally developed for use with Calener, a program for building energy labeling in Spain, these weather files cover all 52 Spanish provincial capitals. Calener was developed by the Grupo de Termotecnia of the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros in Seville for the Spanish Government. The weather files were synthetically generated using Climed
          (Portuguese software developed by Ricardo Aguiar) from mean monthly data coming from the Spanish Meteorological National Institute. These weather files were converted from the DOE-2 binary to EnergyPlus format and include constant wind speeds of 6.7 m/s.</p>

        <p>The Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) project, funded by the United Nations Environment Program, is developing high quality information on solar and wind energy resources in 14 developing countries. Typical year hourly data are available for 156 locations in Belize, Brazil, China, Cuba, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, Maldives, Nicaragua, and Sri Lanka.
          The data are available from the <a href="http://openei.org/SWERA">SWERA project website</a>.</p>
        <h2 name="TMY" id="TMY">Typical Meteorological Year (TMY)</h2>
        <p>Data for 230 locations in the USA plus four locations in Cuba, Marshall Islands, Palau, and Puerto Rico, derived from a 1948-1980 period of record. Many of the locations in the TMY data set were subsequently updated by the TMY2.</p>
        <p>Similar to the TMY2, the TMY are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories.
          Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The data are available for purchase from the National Climatic Data Center.</p>
        <p>All TMY locations are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.</p>
        <h2 name="TMY2" id="TMY2">Typical Meteorological Year 2 (TMY2)</h2>
        <p>The TMY2 are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions,
          they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The data are available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for download or on CD. </p>
        <p>TMY3 files have somewhat replaced TMY2 files but all TMY2 files are available for download from the website.</p>

        <p>Data for 1020 locations in the USA including Guam, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands, derived from a 1991-2005 period of record. All 1020 locations in the TMY3 data set are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.</p>
        <p>The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories.
          Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.
