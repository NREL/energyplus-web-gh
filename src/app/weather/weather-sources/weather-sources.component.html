        <h2 id="CWEC">Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations (CWEC)</h2>
        <p>The 80 CWEC files contain hourly weather observations representing an artificial one-year period specifically designed for building energy calculations. All 80 locations in the CWEC data set are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.</p>
        <p>Produced by Numerical Logics in collaboration with Environment Canada and the National Research Council of Canada, the CWEC were derived using a methodology similar to the TMY2 (see below). CWEC hourly files represent weather conditions
          that result in approximately average heating and cooling loads in buildings. The National Energy Code of Canada requires the use of a CWEC file representative of a location when the performance path and customized design calculations are
          chosen as the means of building energy consumption compliance. The CWEC follow the ASHRAE WYEC2 (Weather Year for Energy Calculation 2) format and were derived from the Canadian Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) of hourly weather
          information for Canada from the 1953-1995 period of record. The CWEC are available from <a href="http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/"> Environment Canada</a>. The reference for the CWEC is:</p>

        <h2 name="TMY" id="TMY">Typical Meteorological Year (TMY)</h2>
        <p>Data for 230 locations in the USA plus four locations in Cuba, Marshall Islands, Palau, and Puerto Rico, derived from a 1948-1980 period of record. Many of the locations in the TMY data set were subsequently updated by the TMY2.</p>
        <p>Similar to the TMY2, the TMY are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories.
          Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The data are available for purchase from the National Climatic Data Center.</p>
        <p>All TMY locations are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.</p>

        <p>The TMY2 are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period.

Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions,
          they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The data are available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for download or on CD. </p>

        <p>The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories.
          Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.
