## Development server
First install node and run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component componentName` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build and Deploy

The site is deployed automatically to the gh-pages branch via GitHub actions. When you are code updates, simply merge them into the main branch and GitHub will take care of the rest.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
